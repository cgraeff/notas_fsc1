  abstract={The higher derivatives of motion are rarely discussed in the teaching of classical mechanics of rigid bodies; nevertheless, we experience the effect not only of acceleration, but also of jerk and snap. In this paper we will discuss the third and higher order derivatives of displacement with respect to time, using the trampolines and theme park roller coasters to illustrate this concept. We will also discuss the effects on the human body of different types of acceleration, jerk, snap and higher derivatives, and how they can be used in physics education to further enhance the learning and thus the understanding of classical mechanics concepts.}

abstract="Physics is well known for its strong emphasis on quantitative theory to guide understanding. In nuclear physics we have numerous theoretical models that explain different aspects of nuclear behavior. In many cases these models build upon each other, for instance, the deformed shell model (or Nilsson model) is a generalization of the shell model. In some cases these models are composited together, the output of one calculation serving as part of the input to another calculation. In this chapter the models that contribute to understanding the nucleus at high spin, particularly in the wobbling mode, are discussed.",
